                <h2>Community Meetings</h2>
                <p>Every Friday, our school community gathers in the gym for Community Meeting. PreKindergarten, Kindergarten, First grade and Second grade scholars meet from 7:30-8:00AM. Third, Fourth and Fifth grade scholars meet from 8:00-8:30AM. We celebrate the successes of our week, learn about the academics that each grade level is working on, explore what our values of Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Development, and Enthusiasm (PRIDE) look like in action, and honor a scholar who demonstrates our values in an exemplary way. We encourage you to join us! Parents and visitors are always welcome to attend.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Spirit Stick and Spirit Tie</h3>
                <p>The highlight of each Community Meeting is when a teacher awards the Spirit Stick to a PreK-2nd grade scholar, and the Spirit Tie to a 3rd-5th grade scholar. Each winner is chosen because their actions during the week best embodied the Prodeo Academy values. The winning scholar proudly keeps the Spirit Stick in his or her classroom during the week and wears the Spirit Tie as part of their uniform. Both are passed on at the next Community Meeting to the new winners.</p>
